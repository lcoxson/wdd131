            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Laura Mosdell Coxson. I grew up in Spanish Fork, Utah with my parents and three siblings. I have studied piano from the time I was seven, and have always had an ear for music. I also enjoy gardening, hiking, crochet, and reading. I live in Kanab, Utah now with my husband and our three kids. I have been teaching piano lessons for many years, though I am currently taking a break from teaching. I am working part-time for BYU-Pathway as a student employee. </p>

            <h2>Kanab, Utah</h2>
            <image id="kanab" src="images/k_hill.jpg" alt="A tall rust-red cliff with the letter K stands before a blue sky"></image>
            <p>Kanab is a small town in southern Utah, just a few miles north of the Arizona border. It is home to stunning red cliffs, and was once known as "Little Hollywood" for the role it played in many western movies. Old movie sets can still be viewed nearby, and plaques with information on actors who have worked here line Center Street. Kanab is close to several national parks, including Zion, Bryce Canyon, and the Grand Canyon. The modern primary industry for Kanab is tourism, though it is also the birthplace of the craft company Stampin' Up and is home to Best Friend's Animal Society headquarters.</p>
